See the HTML documentation in the doc-html directory for installation
instructions and documentation.

If you can't read instructions:

	$ ./configure --with-apxs=/usr/local/apache/sbin/apxs

	$ make
	$ su
	# make install

	Edit httpd.conf like instructions at the end of "make install"
	tell you.

	If the above worked - read the tutorial in the doc directory.

OS Hints:

FreeBSD:        Apache has to be compiled with threads, even if using the
                prefork MPM (recommended). In the ports collection, edit the 
                Makefile to add --enable-threads in the CONFIGURE_ARGS 
                section.
                This has been tested on FreeBSD 4.7; it is possible that
                earlier versions of FreeBSD may have issues with httpd's
                use of threads.
