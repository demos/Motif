This directory contains the mod_python documentation sources.

If you're looking for documentation, go to the ../doc-html
directory, or http://www.modpython.org/. 

This directory is mainly for LaTeX geeks.

In order for anything here to be functional, you must have
configured mod_python with the --with-python option.

You also need to have all the necessary tools installed, see
"Documenting Python" by Fred L. Drake.

If everything is in place, you should be able to generate PDF,
HTML, DVI as well as Postscript file by simply typing one
of the following commands:

make pdf
make html
make dvi
make ps

Good Luck!
